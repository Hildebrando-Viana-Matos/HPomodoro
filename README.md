## About The Project

<p>Welcome to HPomodoro, a platform that will help everyone focus on studying and working using the pomodoro technique.</p>
<p>This technique consists of repeating 3 times a circle of 25 minutes focusing on an action and 5 minutes resting, but the last time the user has to rest 15 minutes.</p>

### OBS

<p>The Ranking page was removed as it was consuming too much Firebase memory, so as long as I don't change the app's Back-End, the Ranking page will not appear on the web.</p>

### Built With

I used some web technologies in order to train:mortar_board::

- ReactJs
- TypeScript
- Sass
- React Icons
- React Router Dom
- React Modal
- i18n
- Firebase
